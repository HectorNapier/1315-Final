<h2>Goals:</h2>
<div id="div1">
  
<p>
  As someone passionate about music and technology, my dream job is to work in a role that combines both interests. Specifically, I aspire to work in the music industry as a software developer or data analyst, creating innovative solutions that improve how we create, listen to, discover, and consume music. I believe that technology has the power to revolutionize the music industry, and I want to be part of a team that can make this happen.
</p>
  
<p>
  To achieve my dream job, I am constantly seeking out new training and education opportunities. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer information systems at West Texas A&M University, which will provide me with a <span style="color: red;">strong foundation in programming, database management, and software engineering</span>. In addition, I have been learning automatic software integration for mastering and mixing songs, as these are new technologies coming out that will impact the music industry significantly in the near future.
</p>
  
<p>
  My experience owning a recording studio as a part-time side business has also given me valuable insights into the music industry. Through working with local artists and musicians, I have gained a deep understanding of the creative process and the challenges that artists face in getting their music heard. This perspective has inspired me to use my technical skills to develop tools and platforms that empower artists to connect with their audiences and succeed in an industry that is constantly evolving. Overall, I am confident that my passion, training, and experience make me well-suited for a career in the technology side of the music industry, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
