  <span style="color: red;">Owning a recording studio</span> as a part-time side business has been a dream of mine for a very long time. From a young age, I was always drawn to music and fascinated by the process of creating it. After years of making music as a hobby, I decided to take the leap and start my studio as a side business a few years ago. It's been an incredible journey so far, working with local artists to create fantastic music, watching their careers grow, and expanding my knowledge about the industry.
</p>

<p>
  My technical skills and experience in oil field management and owning a recording studio have given me a unique perspective on the music industry and how technology can be applied to transform it. My time working in the oil field has given me experience in  <span style="color: red;"><b><i>project management, team leadership, and operations management</span></b></i>, which are all crucial skills in any industry. These skills have taught me how to manage complex projects, handle difficult situations, and lead a team effectively, all of which will be invaluable in the tech and music industries.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, owning a recording studio has given me a firsthand look into the music industry and the challenges and opportunities it presents. It has allowed me to work with local artists, learn the ins and outs of the recording process, and develop a deeper understanding of the music industry as a whole. This experience has given me a unique perspective on how technology can be used to streamline the music production process, improve the quality of recordings, and make music more accessible to a broader audience.
</p>

<p>
  My studies in computer information systems have given me a deeper understanding of how technology can be applied in business settings. For example, one of the critical areas of focus in my program is database design, which has taught me how to create and manage large databases that store and organize complex data. This skill will be particularly useful in the music industry, where data such as sales figures, streaming statistics, and audience demographics can be used to inform business decisions.
