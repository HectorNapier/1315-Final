<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<div id="div1">
<p>
My name is <b>Hector Napier</b>, and I'm a student at <b><i>West Texas A&M</i></b> studying<span style="color: red;"> Computer Information systems</span>. Originally born and raised in Venezuela, I've spent over 15  years in the United States, mainly in Houston, TX. I am passionate about many things in life, primarily music, and sports. I grew up playing many sports and music; therefore, my dream has always been to pursue a career in one of these professional fields, such as system analysis, software development, or business intelligence engineering.
</p>
  <p>
     I have spent my entire career working in the oil field and worked in various roles, from drilling to refining, and have gained a wealth of experience over the years. Despite my success, I have always been drawn to the tech world, particularly the music industry. I have always had a passion for music and have dreamed of working in a role that combines my technical skills with my love of music. After years of working in the oil field, I am ready to change and pursue my dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transitioning from the oil field to the tech world will be challenging. I'll need to gain new skills, build my network, and prove myself. But I am up for the challenge. I have been studying programming and web development at West Texas A&M and have been networking with people in the tech and music industries. I have also been reaching out to companies that work with technology and music, hoping to land an entry-level job that will allow me to learn and grow in my new field.
